                <p>I am Arivazhagan, born in Salem on  4 th September, 1967. My father Mr. M. Natesan  is a  high school teacher, My Mother Mrs. N. Indirani is a homemaker. I  studied in government schools in small villages, as my father was working there. He was  always interested in nature, and in every school he worked he planted several trees, and it developed in me an interest in planting trees from an young age and an intent in serving the society. Well folks, if you read about me today, you might feel it was a pretty decent life that I was blessed with but to every coin there are a couple of sides. I consider myself privileged to have grown up amongst the nature, but my interests beaconed me towards technology. As you know that in those days, there was a little awakening in technical domain. Although the world was fast moving in the direction of a technical revolution but in distant corners of Salem in Tamil Nadu, we were still living in the Indian culture. A normal government job, a decent small family and a peaceful life. But at youth, blood boils and I had that rare boiling blood to make a break-through. I wanted to be break away from the cocoon of well-defined life and achieve something which I wanted. But I didn't exactly knew how. However, one day in my school, I got my path on which I dedicated the rest of my life and I am still fathoming in the same tread. I was, to serve people for a good cause.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>Gradually, those colourful days of childhood vanished as the ink of responsibility was slowly spreading across my canvas of life. And like all students, I had to appear for my boar exams. And honestly, it was very stressful. To memorize history and geography. However, I tried my best and did well in them and passed successfully. Once, I received my 12th marksheet, I got a breath of fresh air in my lungs of dreams. I was now, eligible to walk along the way in which I had long dreamt of. I was admitted to the Adiparasakthi Engineering College of Chennai which came under the University of Madras. I successfully secured a seat in ECE, which was the most respected and the highest scoring stream in those day of pre-computer era. And getting registered, a new life had enrolled in the almanac of my life. Truly, college life is the best life. We emerged in worries, yet laughed at each others, had made our hands dirty in intelligent pranks, made friends for life and enjoyed every moment in our style.</p>

                <p>I completed my Bachelors in Electronics Engineering at University of Madras, in 1989 and joined Telematics System, Chennai as a Production Engineer. At first, job life was really exciting for me but after a couple of years I lost interest. I found no point in working at a place where I was doing the similar tasks repeatedly. I needed some adventure in the field of knowledge. So, I pursued and completed my M.S in computer science at BITS, Pilani in 1995. Later out of interest,  I completed MBA at Madurai Kamaraj University. Realizing the scope of contributing to the society through the research in the field of medical diagnosis I pursued my Doctoral research in Medical Imaging at  SRM Institute of Science and Technology. I  have published research articles on the role of artificial intelligence in medical field in various journals and conferences. And from then onwards, I found myself being placed at the throne of my dreams. I could walk with a very high head amongst my buddies and relatives. But somewhere, my father's priceless teachings of being humble anchored me to the ground and today, I really value what I jewel was passed on by him to me.</p>

                <p>I started my career as a Production engineer, as I had mentioned and then switched over to teaching in Polytechnic College and then in Engineering  college and University because of my interest  in serving people and particularly student community. I had the knack and the natural ability to make complicated things look easy. That's where my entire interest in technology came from. And then I had got exactly what I wanted in life. A medium to serve. A cause to advance a helping hand and guide the saplings of the humanity tree into a blooming forest imparting cool shade of patience, sympathy, forgiveness and sharing. I got the scepter to direct the younger generations into a life of honour. And a divine feeling embraced me and filled my soul with an unearthly happiness. From my young age I used to read books. Every time I read the books on great personalities who served people, I aspire to be one such a person. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Sir, inspired me to dive into technology and hunt and solve the root of every problem, be it technical or humanitarian. The life and literature of Rabindranath Tagore inspired me to walk alone when the situations turn sour and we find none by our side. Chanakya's teachings taught me to stay calm in every situation in life. And most importantly, Gautam Buddha's teachings enlightened me to live my life in the paths of Nirvana and find ultimate peace in giving and honouring others.  I am keen in  doing social activities that would uplift and empower the  lifestyle of socially backward community. </p>

                <p>
                    And finally, one day I got married. My wife M.M. Uma Maheswari,  is also an educator in University. Our two sons are, Aravind, a Process Development Scientist and Anandha Adhithyan,  an Architect. Today, I am a Senior Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering at SRM Institute, Tamil Nadu and still counting days of my progress after 30 years of my service. And as long as I have students around me and the noble cause to live, I will be always excited to work tirelessly.
